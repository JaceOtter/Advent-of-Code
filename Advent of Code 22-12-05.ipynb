    "The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\n",

    "The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks.

After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\n",
